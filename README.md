Have you ever thought to yourself "Hey I want to do some machine learning, what do I need to know?" and then after some extensive reading you think "Huh, maybe I should just go get a PhD in ML".

Asking yourself all these questions can be overwhelming, and in ML it is sometimes easy to fall down a rabbit hole. But in this video, Cami appeals to those who really just want to get something up and running with ML as quickly as possible. 

She walks you through how to discover projects that make ML easier, and writes a small application utilizing Detectron2!
